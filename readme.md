== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin developed? =

This plugin was developed because of the need of having a date and time picker field on a contact form that did not include this type of field.
Using this plugin you can convert any text input field into a data time picker field. Including on contact forms.

= How do I prevent the datetimepicker scripts and styles from loading across all my website? =

In the settings page for the plugin you can find the option to load the necessary files only when the shortcode [datetimepicker] exists on the page.
If you have this option selected, the plugin will only look for fields to convert when this shortcode exists on that page.
